# data/

This mini-app generates synthetic initial conditions (warm bubble) at runtime.
No external datasets are required for baseline runs.

If you later incorporate real or larger datasets, place small samples here and
add a `fetch_full_data.sh` script to download full-resolution data from public
sources. Document provenance and licensing for any added datasets.
