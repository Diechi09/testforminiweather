# EuroHPC Development Access Proposal Outline (6–8 pages)

## Abstract & Objectives
- Concise summary of the project goals and anticipated outcomes.
- Emphasize educational value and HPC skill development.

## State of the Art and Motivation
- Brief overview of weather/climate mini-apps and stencil codes.
- Why hybrid MPI+OpenMP is relevant for EuroHPC systems.

## Current Code & Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
- Description of the miniWeather prototype, current capabilities.
- TRL estimate and justification.

## Target EuroHPC Machine & Software Stack
- Identify target system (e.g., LUMI, Leonardo) and architecture.
- Compiler/MPI/runtime details; any accelerator use (optional).

## Work Plan
- Milestones with dates: baseline, scaling studies, profiling, optimisation.
- Tasks: code cleanup, parameter sweeps, profiling, documentation.
- Risks and mitigations; support needed from HPC centre.

## Resource Justification
- Node-hour formula (e.g., hours = steps * repeats * configs * nodes).
- Example calculation for strong and weak scaling campaigns.
- Storage and data transfer needs.

## Data Management / FAIR / Ethics
- Plans for sharing code/results; repository location.
- Handling of any future datasets and licensing considerations.

## Expected Impact
- Educational impact, skills developed, and potential for future grants.
- Path to extend to GPU or add physics for research use.
